    "In this post I won't discuss Flutter as you are used to, but I will go back to my roots: Python. Python is an extremely convenient lanuage since it has hundruds of usefull packages which make you more productive. Here, I will share two awesome packages nbdev[^1] and FastAPI[^2]. Furthermore. I will show you how to combine these two packages to create an awesome documented web-API."

    "\n",
    "FastAPI is based on two packages. Firstly, Starlette[^3], a lightweight Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI) framework. Secondly, Pydantic[^4], a data validation package using Python type annotations. Due to the async capabilities its fast and do to Pydantich and Python's type annotations it helps you speed up your API development and it helps you preventing errors. And, as icing on the cake, it autogenerates API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger and Redoc). However, it does not cover code documentation, which is necessary to cooperate efficiently with other developers. That is one of the strengths of using Notebook development with nbdev."

    "Nbdev improves developing in Notebooks by extracting code into Python modules (which already solve the Notebooks version control horrer and order of code execution)! Additionally, using Notebooks you can let your creative genius fly and do all the exploratory development you want since your findings are easily integrated in a module. Lastly, your Markdown cells is used to create documentation automatically! In my opinion, this solves a massive problem in software engineering, namely proper code documentation. You are now able to explain your code choices with text, images, links, graphs you name it!  \n",
